I'm studying physics, and I build things. The idea for
[caefisica.com](https://caefisica.com) didn't come from wanting another project, it came
from a recurring problem that I had and thought other students faced too.

The hardest part of a class often wasn't the material itself. It was finding the right
resources: class notes, past exams, or book recommendations that could make a difference.
You could spend days studying with a book that covered your topic but went deep into
irrelevant topics for your particular class[^1], so you'd end up moving to the next book,
and the next, and the next, wasting time you could have used productively.

<Mark>You need to self-study effectively</Mark> to succeed in this career. The faculty
struggles with punctuality, motivation and engagement—partly due to age gaps, since few
young professors teach here. Teaching quality varies widely. You only discover this only
after enrolling in courses, so you must adapt by identifying the important topics and
practicing problem-solving as soon as possible. Sometimes professors share their
textbooks, but often you have to figure it out alone.

So... how do we solve this? The solution seemed simple: after finishing a course, why not
have students who passed share their study materials? Their notes, helpful YouTube
channels, books, and recommendations. They've already been through this process and know
what works and what doesn't.

# The problem of trapped knowledge

At our school, the School of Physics, we have a knowledge fragmentation problem. Each
graduating class, or _base_[^2], has (sometimes) its own collection of resources.
Professors share materials with their classes—solved problems, theory notes, formula
sheets—but once the semester ends, that material usually just fades out of existence,
forgotten by those who passed.

Students from one class rarely share notes or exams with newer students, which is
understandable since it's not their responsibility and they may not know people from other
classes.

  New students are left out. They can't access years of accumulated knowledge that could
  help them prepare. This particularly affects first-year students who haven't built
  connections with upperclassmen who could tell them which professors to avoid or how to
  approach specific courses.

Sometimes a class creates its own repository, like a shared Google Drive folder. This
happened to the class of 2019 but the material only spanned about 2 or 3 semesters and was
very limited. The class of 2019 created one that spanned 2-3 semesters with limited
material. The <Mark>class of 2020</Mark>, initially led by Nelson Noa who was class
delegate at the time, built a comprehensive repository covering all six semesters with
materials from many courses. But this was a one-time effort that wasn't maintained after
graduation[^3]. The class of 2021 didn't manage to create anything similar.

We'll know we're successful when we've built a place where any student, from any year, can
easily find what they need, even for advanced courses from areas A, B, or C.[^4]

# What we want to achieve

Our goal is straightforward: we want every physics student to have an equal shot at
success. When we say "opportunities," we mean that everyone should know about the same
scholarships, have easy access to the same books, and hear the same recommendations.
That's it.

Our mission is to keep information flowing for all students' benefit.

# Our game plan

We're tackling this in phases.

First, we built the basics. We set up social media channels and a public WhatsApp group to
start sharing opportunities right away. Then we prototyped and launched the first version
of [caefisica.com](https://caefisica.com), focused on the 2018 curriculum in less than a
year.

The website is built with <Mark color="rgba(245, 40, 145, 0.8)">Hugo</Mark>, a static site
generator, which makes it incredibly fast. We paired it with <Mark>Bootstrap</Mark> for
the design and a headless CMS to manage content. We even set up a GitHub Action that
automatically checks for broken links, maintaining resource reliability. This whole
process happened openly between early 2022 and 2023. You can view and build the entire
project from Github at [caefisica/web-main](https://github.com/caefisica/web-main).

  Right now, we're working on getting more content. We're trying to get help from teachers
  to review what we wrote and give criticisms to the guides, and we're transcribing
  handwritten notes into LaTeX for better searchability and usability.

You can see this work at the [caefisica/NotasTeX](https://github.com/caefisica/NotasTeX)
repository. We're also building a scrapping tool to automatically share scholarships and
events across all our WhatsApp groups and the website, eliminating manual posting.[^5]

Next, we want to expand. We're also working on a news feed that automatically pulls
physics-related articles. The repository is at
[caefisica/news-reader](https://github.com/caefisica/news-reader), with data scraping
improvements at [caefisica/news-scraper](https://github.com/caefisica/news-scraper). We
are also looking into ways to improve site search and automate social media posts.

Many ideas, one maintainer. But with more people involved, I think we can make this work.

# How we'll know if this is working

Success for us isn’t about traffic numbers, since **physics undergraduates** is already a
niche group, and 800 visits a month is already plenty.

We'll succeed if:

- Students from different classes contribute new content
- More students apply for exchanges and graduate school using information we provide
- New student groups form around specific physics areas
- People actually give us feedback on the site and suggest new ideas

And we'll fail if:

- Nobody uses our channels
- Exchange program participation remains unchanged
- The website becomes stale and outdated
- We end up building this in a bubble, without talking to other students

@caefisica attempts to build something useful for the community. I've learned from others'
videos and code and benefited from the tools they built, so I want to contribute back. If
someone else can avoid the same obstacles I faced, that's a win.

    I didn't found @caefisica—it was founded by a group from the class of 2016,
    particularly Renzo Franco, whom I had the pleasure of interacting with and hearing his
    recommendations (and complaints about the faculty).

  <p>
    Thanks to the entire @caefisica team (both past and present contributors) for bringing
    the site to life.

    I'm not saying you should study only for your exam. But it's reassuring to know that
    you are ready for the upcoming exam and can focus more on the class itself.

[^2]:
    Yep, that's how we call it, _base_. This seems unique to the UNMSM. It is not a term
    in other universities even in the Lima region as far as I know.

[^3]: Class of 2020 was expected to graduate on December of 2024.

[^4]:
    Area A covers materials and solid state physics, Area B focuses on theoretical and
    nuclear physics, and Area C covers astronomy and geophysics

[^5]: It is a nightmare having to constantly use Facebook.
